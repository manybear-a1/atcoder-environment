Let's start by analyzing the problem in the statement.html.
For example: 
[]: # What type of problem is it? Suited for Simulated Annealing or Beam Search or something else? If evaluation cost is high, is it able to reduce the cost of evaluation? Maybe just approximate the evaluation function is enough to Simulated Annealing.
[]: # What are the key components (or concepts) of the problem? What are the inputs, outputs, constraints and input generation?
[]: # Provide a clear and concise description of the problem.
