State contains the entire state of the problem, including the current position, the current score, and any other relevant information. This state will output the state in the format specified in statement.md at last.

Action contains the action that can be taken in the problem, such as moving to a new position or changing the score.This action will be used to update the state and will also output each action in the format specified in statement.md at last.

The format is written in the statement.md.
If statement.md is unavailable, deny editing and say  "statement.md is unavailable.".
